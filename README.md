# 🔬 AlphaFold3–AutoDock Vina Binding Affinity Pipeline

This repository provides a streamlined pipeline to compute binding affinities for protein–ligand complexes generated by AlphaFold3.  
It takes an AlphaFold3-style JSON input containing the protein sequence and ligand SMILES, reconstructs the 3D structure, prepares the complex for docking, and uses AutoDock Vina to calculate the binding affinity.

---

## 🚀 Features

- ✅ Accepts AlphaFold3-style JSON input files (e.g., `fold_input.json`)
- 🔍 Automatically extracts protein and ligand information
- 🧪 Converts ligand SMILES to 3D structure using Open Babel
- 💧 Adds polar hydrogens to both protein and ligand
- 🧭 Generates grid box around predicted binding site
- 🧬 Performs docking using AutoDock Vina
- 📉 Outputs predicted **binding energy (kcal/mol)

## 📦 Requirements

Before using the pipeline, ensure the following system dependencies and Python packages are installed:

### 📗 System Packages

- Python ≥ 3.7  
- `wget` (Linux/macOS)  
- [`autodock-vina`](http://vina.scripps.edu/) (Vina 1.2.x or newer)  
- `openbabel` (for SMILES to 3D conversion and PDBQT generation)

Install system packages on Debian/Ubuntu:

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y openbabel autodock-vina wget
